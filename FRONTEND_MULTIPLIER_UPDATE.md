## Frontend Multiplier System Update

✅ **Updated React Frontend to Match New Multiplier System**

### Changes Made:

1. **Weight Initialization**:

   - Equal weighting now sets all portfolios to 1.0x (full scale) instead of dividing by count
   - Custom multipliers default to 1.0x instead of equal fractions

2. **Validation Logic**:

   - Removed requirement for weights to sum to 1.0 (100%)
   - Added validation for positive multipliers only
   - Updated error messages

3. **UI Display**:

   - Changed "Weight:" labels to "Multiplier:"
   - Show "2.0x" instead of "200%"
   - Replaced "Total Weight" with "Total Scale"
   - Updated input field: removed max="1", changed step to 0.1

4. **User Interface**:

   - "Equal Weighting" → "Equal Scaling (1.0x each)"
   - "Custom Weighting" → "Custom Multipliers"
   - Added helpful explanation of multiplier system
   - "Normalize to 100%" → "Reset to 1.0x"

5. **Optimization Results**:
   - Show "Optimal multipliers found" instead of "weights found"
   - Display as "2.0x" format instead of percentage

### Multiplier System Benefits:

- **Intuitive**: 1.0 = full portfolio, 2.0 = double, 0.5 = half
- **Flexible**: Any positive number works (no normalization required)
- **Clear**: Easier to understand than percentage weights
- **Powerful**: Can scale portfolios beyond 100% (leveraging effect)

### Example Use Cases:

- Conservative: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] = Half scale all portfolios
- Aggressive: [2.0, 1.5, 1.0] = Double first, 1.5x second, full third
- Focused: [3.0, 0.2, 0.1] = Heavy focus on first portfolio

The frontend now matches the backend multiplier system perfectly!
