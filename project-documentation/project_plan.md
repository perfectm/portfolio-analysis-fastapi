# Portfolio Analysis FastAPI - Comprehensive Improvement Project Plan

## Executive Summary

This project plan outlines a systematic approach to modernize and secure a full-stack portfolio analysis application. The application currently provides Monte Carlo simulations, risk metrics calculations, and interactive visualizations for trading strategies through a FastAPI backend with React frontend.

**Current Architecture:**
- **Backend:** FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM, PostgreSQL/SQLite fallback
- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript + Material-UI + Vite
- **Deployment:** Docker containers on Render.com
- **Key Features:** Portfolio upload, analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, multi-portfolio blending

**Critical Issues Identified:**
1. **Security:** No authentication, rate limiting, or input validation
2. **Code Quality:** Complex functions, inconsistent error handling, magic numbers
3. **Performance:** Memory-intensive operations, no caching, inefficient data processing
4. **Architecture:** Mixed concerns, ad-hoc migrations, complex fallback logic
